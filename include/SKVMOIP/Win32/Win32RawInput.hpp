		Key Code: Virtual Code

		Repeat Count:
		
		You can check the repeat count to determine whether a keystroke message represents more than one keystroke. 
		The system increments the count when the keyboard generates WM_KEYDOWN or WM_SYSKEYDOWN messages faster than an application can process them. 
		This often occurs when the user holds down a key long enough to start the keyboard's automatic repeat feature. 
		Instead of filling the system message queue with the resulting key-down messages, 
		the system combines the messages into a single key down message and increments the repeat count. 
		Releasing a key cannot start the automatic repeat feature, so the repeat count for WM_KEYUP and WM_SYSKEYUP messages is always set to 1.

		Scan Codes:
		
		The scan code is the value that the system generates when the user presses a key. 
		It is a value that identifies the key pressed regardless of the active keyboard layout, 
		as opposed to the character represented by the key. An application typically ignores scan codes. 
		Instead, it uses the virtual-key codes to interpret keystroke messages.

		Modern keyboards are using Human Interface Devices (HID) specification to communicate with a computer. 
		Keyboard driver converts reported HID Usage values sent from the keyboard to scan —Åodes and passes them on to applications.


		Extended Key Flag:

		The extended-key flag indicates whether the keystroke message originated from one of the additional keys on the Enhanced 101/102-key keyboard. 
		The extended keys consist of the ALT and CTRL keys on the right-hand side of the keyboard; 
		the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; 
		the NUM LOCK key; the BREAK (CTRL+PAUSE) key; the PRINT SCRN key; and the divide (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. 
		The right-hand SHIFT key is not considered an extended-key, it has a separate scan code instead.

		If specified, the scan code consists of a sequence of two bytes, where the first byte has a value of 0xE0.
