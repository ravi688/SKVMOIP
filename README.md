# KVM Over IP
This repository contains source code for a KVM over IP client for Windows and Linux platforms.

There are many options available in the market for KVKM over IP, however most of them either for a corporate or very expensive for individuals - and still not scalable enough.

Therefore, I started this project to invent a scalable KVM Over IP software suite we can be installed on cheap hardware modules and on a client computer. This KVMK Over IP is scalable to any size because it uses ethernet wiring to communicate with the computers/servers.


### Hardware Requirements
1. STM32F401CCU6 Microcontroller
2. W5500 Wizchip Ethernet Module
3. ST Link Programmer
4. HDMI capture device
5. A client computer either running Windows or Linux.

### What's in the Software Suite
1. Firmware Software for STM32401CCU6 and W5500 WizChip
2. Client Software for a Client Computer.

### How to setup the KVMOIP?
TODO
